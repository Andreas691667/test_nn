# Models
This folder contains the different models that are used in the project. 

## Folder structure
All folders have the same structure with a `readme.md` file that explains the model and its functionalities, a `config.py` file that contains the configuration of the model, and a `model.py` file that contains the implementation of the model. Moreover, an `example.py` file is included to show how the model can be used.
